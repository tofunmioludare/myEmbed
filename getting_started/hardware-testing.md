# Testing the Hardware
Now you have all the key software tools, it's time to start testing the hardware.

## Connecting and Updating your Development Board
1. [Download the test image here](https://github.com/UniversityOfPlymouth-Electronics/Embedded-Systems/raw/master/Hardware/ModuleSupportBoard/board-test.bin)
1. Drag and Drop this onto your target board

[Click here to watch a video explaining how to do this](https://plymouth.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=fca139f3-1931-4bb6-a22d-abfb00fa99a8)

If everything is working (as shown in the video) we can proceed to writing our first piece of software.

If the board is not working, check the following:

* The USB cable is connected to the correct end (oppose end to the network connector)
* The Power LED next to the USB connector is on and not flashing

If you cannot resolve these issues, please contact the module staff using Teams.
